# Messagist

# What I used

* Koin for dependency management
* Kotlin Coroutines for async/concurrent operations
* Arrow for Data Types
* Glide for image loading
* Gson for JSON parsing
* SQLDelight for the DB
* The messaging approach I'm using lately for ViewModels and Views

# What I learned

This was my first adventure with SQLDelight and I have to say I enjoyed it a lot.

It feels less magic than Room and it triggers a lot of memories from the old days at the Uni when I was using a lot of SQL.
The overall experience was very pleasant and I liked the fact the if I didn't know something, I could simply Google for Sqlite documentation.

With SQLDelight there is no need to dive too much in the tool itself. I just needed some basic SQL and I pulled it off.

# Final thoughts

I will probably advocate for SQLDelight in the future, when a discussion about DBs, Rooms, ORM et similia will arise.
